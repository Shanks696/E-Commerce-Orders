 - Dataset imported from Excel into Power Query for cleaning and transformation.

🔎 Understanding the Data

During initial exploration, the following inconsistency was identified:

 - Null values in the Order Source column.

🧹 Data Cleaning

 - Handled null values by imputing them with the most frequently occurring values in their respective columns to maintain data consistency and reliability.
